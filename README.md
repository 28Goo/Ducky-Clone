# Final Project: Ducky Clone

#### Live Preview: https://ducky-clone.herokuapp.com/

## Description:

This is my Final Project for Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x). I created a clone of Ducky's store website and redesigned it. The website contains a landing page, about page, contacts page and two series of Ducky's products with their own specific website to showcase its features and specifications.

## Design Choice:

The design choice were all inspired by various websites I saw in [Awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/). I tried to mimic the design that was created on those websites. By doing that, I was able to enhance my front end skills especially styling my HTML using CSS. I made it look minimalist so that everything will look pleasant to the eyes and not look totally overwhelming at first sight.

All of the pages in the final project are responsive by using media queries.

## Disclaimer:

All the information in the clone are from Ducky themselves which I got from their own website. I do not own any information that is presented on the website that I created.
