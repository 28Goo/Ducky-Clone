## Description:

This is my Final Project for Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x). I created a clone of Ducky's store website and redesigned it. The website contains a landing page, about page, contacts page and two series of Ducky's products with their own specific website to showcase its features and specifications.

The landing page contains the brand name, the Limited Zodiac Edition series and the One 2 Series. The Limited Zodiac Series contains a short description about what the series is all about. The landing page also contains a header and a footer. The header contains two a tags, first is the "About Us" tag that directs you to a site about the history of Ducky and what their vision is. The second is the "Contacts" tag that directs you to a site where you can see all the necessary information to contact Ducky and also a site where you can buy their products specifically here in the Phiippines. It also contains two buttons that will direct you to see an overview of the two series mentioned above.

## Design Choice:

The design choice were all inspired by various websites I saw in Awwwards.com. I tried to mimic the design that was created on those websites. By doing that, I was able to enhance my front end skills especially styling my HTML using CSS. I made it look minimalist so that everything will look pleasant to the eyes and not look totally overwhelming at first sight.

All of the pages in the final project are responsive. That means that it can look good even when you are using your iPad/Tablet ot mobilephones. I made it responsive by using media queries.

## Disclaimer:

All the information in the clone are from Ducky themselves which I got from their own website. I do not own any information that is presented on the website that I created.
