#### Description:

This is my Final Project for Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x). I created a clone of Ducky's store website and redesigned it. The website contains a landing page, about page, contacts page and two series of Ducky's products with their own specific website to showcase its features and specifications.

The landing page contains the brand name, the Limited Zodiac Edition series and the One 2 Series. The Limited Zodiac Series contains a short description about what the series is all about. The landing page also contains a header and a footer. The header contains two a tags, first is the "About Us" tag that directs you to a site about the history of Ducky and what their vision is. The second is the "Contacts" tag that directs you to a site where you can see all the necessary information to contact Ducky and also a site where you can buy their products specifically here in the Phiippines. It also contains two buttons that will direct you to see an overview of the two series mentioned above.

The Limited Zodiac Edition Series page gives you an overview of the products in the series. There are six keyboards in the series, Year of the Rat, Pig, Dog, Rooster, Monkey and Goat. Each with their own site. You can access their site by clicking on the picture of the keyboard. The individual pages of the keyboards presents their own features and specifications.

The same goes with the One 2 Series page. There are also six keyboards in the series, namely One 2 Rosa, Tuxedo, Bon Voyage, Skyline, Horizon, and Midnight. Every keyboard's site is also accessible by clicking the keyboard. The individual pages of the keyboards presents their own features and specifications.

I added animations on the landing page wherein when the website loads, you will be greeted with a quote from Ducky and some fancy animations when you scroll on the landing page. On hover animations were add in the One 2 Series part of the landing page wherein when you hover on specific parts of the One 2 Series screen, the names of the products will show up. I also added some hover animations on the Series Websites (Limited Zodiac Edition and One 2 Series) wherein when you hover on the keyboards, their names will show up.

The design choice were all inspired by various websites I saw in Awwwards.com. I tried to mimic the design that was created on those websites. By doing that, I was able to enhance my front end skills especially styling my HTML using CSS. I made it look minimalist so that everything will look pleasant to the eyes and not look totally overwhelming at first sight.

All of the pages in the final project are responsive. That means that it can look good even when you are using your iPad/Tablet ot mobilephones. I made it responsive by using media queries.

All the information in the clone are from Ducky themselves which I got from their own website. I do not own any information that is presented on the website that I created.
